### JDK Manager (jdk-manager.ps1)

A PowerShell script to manage JDK installations using Chocolatey.

#### Features:
- Install JDK versions (currently supports Amazon Corretto 17 and 21)
- Update installed JDKs
- Switch between JDK versions (sets JAVA_HOME and updates PATH)
- Check for JDK updates

#### Usage:
1. Run the script in PowerShell with administrator privileges:
   ```
   powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File jdk-manager.ps1
   ```
2. Follow the menu options to manage your JDK installations

#### Notes:
- The script automatically detects JDK installation paths using Chocolatey
- If Chocolatey information is not available, it falls back to searching common installation directories
- You need to restart your terminal after switching JDK versions for the changes to take effect
